This application is a protein structure prediction tool that processes amino acid sequences to compute secondary and tertiary structural features. It integrates advanced bioinformatics algorithms for folding prediction, residue-level analysis, stability scoring, and 3D visualization. The interactive interface allows users to input sequences and instantly generate structural predictions, enabling rapid exploration of sequence–structure relationships. Deployed on Streamlit, the app provides scalable, browser-based access to protein modeling capabilities without the need for local installation, making it a practical tool for researchers, students, and bioinformatics enthusiasts.

This application leverages concepts from **ESMFold**, a transformer-based deep learning model, to predict protein tertiary structures. Users can input sequences and instantly generate predicted structures, which can be explored interactively with 3D visualizations powered by `stmol` and `py3Dmol`. Structural analysis and manipulations are supported using `biotite`.
